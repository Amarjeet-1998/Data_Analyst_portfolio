### Steps to design dashboards in **Tableau**

The process never starts from Tableau itself but I will give you a detailed walkthrough of my process:

1. Identify your KPIs
a. Identify the specific dimensions and measures
b. Identify their relation. eg. Sales by country

2. Draft a layout
a. Use pen/paper (highly recommended)
b. Draw a layout in the form of boxes or placeholders (check Tableau Containers)
c. Place your KPIs on the boxes.
d. Draw a chart to display relation with KPIs.

3. Brainstrom
a. Connect the layout with the problem statement.
b. Discuss the story.
c. Rearrange the KPI boxes if needed
d. identify the drop-downs like filter, parameter
e. Identify the headers and title of the dashboard and views.

4. Build in Tableau
a. Create your calculations
b. Create your charts
c. Apply the filters and parameters
d. Format your charts and titles

5. Build your Dashboard - 1
a. Create your calculations
b. Create your charts
c. Apply filters and parameters
d. Format your charts and titles

6. Build your dashboard - 2
a. Place filters and parameters if required
b. Place the header using text boxes
c. Place the navigation buttons
d. Add the dashboard actions

This process helps me to create the first cut of the dashboard! and with further iterations over design we can make it better.
